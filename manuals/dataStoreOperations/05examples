Here come the examples how to use the API. Let us assume we have a blank datastore.


First order of business is to initialize service types. This command is not part of the API, but it is convenient for
the development process:

curl -i -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/initServiceTypes

Let us now create three hosts. We specify POST requests to {url}/hosts giving in the data part of the request information about the hosts we want to create.
Here we give the requested host names and Ip's:

curl -i -X POST -d'{"ipv6":null,"ipv4":"192.41.236.31","hostname":"psmsu01.aglt2.org"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts
curl -i -X POST -d'{"ipv6":null,"hostname":"lhcperfmon.bnl.gov"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts
curl -i -X POST -d'{"ipv4":"999.999.99.99","hostname":"abcd.com"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts


We can verify that the hosts were created by 


curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts


and we can get details about , for example, host 2 by


curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts/2


Now we want to add all primitive services to hosts 1

curl -i -X PUT -d'["1"]' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts/1/addallservices

Verify that the servies were added:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts/1

We can add throughput primitive services to host3:

curl -i -X PUT -d'["1"]' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts/3/addthroughputservices


and verify that they were added

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/hosts/3


Let us now create a matrix. It should be of type "throughput" and it should have a name BBB.

curl -i -X POST -d'{"serviceTypeId":"throughput","name":"BBB"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices


verify that this matrix has been created:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices

Let us get more information about this matrix:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices/1

and we see that it is empty and contains no hosts. So let us add them.



Now we want to add hosts 1,2,3 to this matrix


curl -i -X PUT -d'["1","2","3"]' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices/1/addhostids


Let us verify that the hosts were added:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices/1


Now let us create two perfSonar sites:


curl -i -X POST -d'{"name":"First Site"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/sites
curl -i -X POST -d'{"name":"Second Site"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/sites

Let us verify that they were created:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/sites


Now let us create two clouds:


curl -i -X POST -d'{"name":"CLOUD"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/clouds
curl -i -X POST -d'{"name":"Another Cloud"}' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/clouds

and let us verify that they were created


curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/clouds

Let us add site 2 to cloud 1

curl -i -X PUT -d'["2"]' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/clouds/1/addsiteids

and now let us add matrix 1 to cloud 1

curl -i -X PUT -d'["1"]' http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/clouds/1/addmatrixids

verify that they were added:

curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8084/dashboard2/matrices/1


That is all for now.
