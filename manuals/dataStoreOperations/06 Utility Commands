In this section I will describe some utility commands. They are not part of the API, they should not be used when developing applications, butbthey may be useful when managing or debugging the server.


In order to count the service results records issue a GET request to

{url}/requests

for example:

curl -i -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://perfsonar.racf.bnl.gov:8080/dashboard2-1.0-SNAPSHOT/results

It will return a JSON object containing the number of records found and the timestamp of the oldest record:

{"minTime":"2013-06-07T00:00:18.000Z","numberOfRecords":349568}


If you want to know the number of results older than a specific time do


{url}/requests?tmax={time}

for example


curl -i -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://perfsonar.racf.bnl.gov:8080/dashboard2-1.0-SNAPSHOT/r2sults?tmax=2013-07-06T00:00:00.000Z

In order to delete records older than specific time do a DELETE request to

{url}/requests?tmax={time}

It will delete the oldest records. This command should be used carefully, so in order not to lead you to temptation I do not print an explicit example how to use it. If you really really want to use it - you need to construct the command yourself instead of doing copy - paste, since copy-paste is to easy and could lead to mistakes.
